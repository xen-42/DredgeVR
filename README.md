It makes the game VR.

This mod uses the mod loader and manager available on [dredgemods.com](https://dredgemods.com/)

This mod uses SteamVR so you have to have Steam installed to use it. In theory it will work on non-Steam versions of the game but I haven't tested it.

Has built in controller bindings for Oculus and Valve Index. You might have to set up your own bindings for other controllers.
